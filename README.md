# Receipt-Scanner-Simulator

How to use it:
Add Items: Use the "Item Name" and "Price" input fields to add items to your grocery list. Click "Add Item" after each entry.

Scan Receipt: Once you have added all your items, click "Scan Receipt". You'll see the simulated receipt "type out" line by line in the display area.

Clear Receipt: To start over, click "Clear Receipt" to clear both the displayed receipt and your item list.

I've used Tailwind CSS for quick styling, a monospace font for the receipt, and JavaScript's setTimeout to create the typing animation. Enjoy simulating your grocery receipts!
